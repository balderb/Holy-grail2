                <h3>Putting renovation of European residences on the agenda</h3>
                <h4>Global perspectives on the importance of global renovation:</h4>
                <p>The global challenge to accelerate the transition to a better, more inclusive, sustainable economy has 
                    never been more important. Cities, with their high concentration of people, economic activity and infrastructure, 
                    offer a unique opportunity to tackle climate change. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, 3.9 billion people live in cities and, according to the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects, 
                    the urban population is expected to grow by another 2.5 billion by 2050. However, these densely populated and 
                    built up areas are not realising their full potential to drive sustainable development and prosperity. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Across the planet more than 28% of greenhouse gas emissions derive from energy use in buildings. This number 
                    is destined to increase by 50% by 2050 if no actions are taken. Reaching the Paris climate goals requires urgent 
                    action to avoid further lock in to inefficient and climate vulnerable buildings and homes. This will require upscaled 
                    investment in the renovation of the existing building stock.
